Answer the following questions:
- Which command did you use to set the permissions for 'task2.txt'?
chmod 600 task2.txt
- Which command did you use to set the permissions for 'file.txt'?
chmod 400 file.txt
- Explain how to read these permission strings (e.g. `rw-rw-r--`).
Read and write for the owner and the group. Only read of all other users
- How do these permission strings relate to octal permissions (e.g. `0644`)?
The permissions are related to octal numbers. There are permissions for owner, group and all
So the permissions are represented by a 4 digit octal number where each digit represents one of the following
1. (4)setuid, (2)setgid and (1)sticky bit

(4) read (2) write (1) execute
2. owner permissions
3. group permissions
4. all other users permissions (others)
- What is the benefit of having 'groups' and 'others'?
You can control exactly what and how users can do with a file. groups allows to set specific permissions
for user groups. And others allows for default values for newly created users or users without a group
- In your opinion, what are the ideal permissions for ...
  - ... a text file used to take private notes?
  0600
  - ... a shell script?
  0710 so the owner/sudo can edit and only permitted users can execute
  - ... a config file that should not be edited?
  0644 so the owner/sudo can edit but all others can just read

Hand 'task2.txt' as your solution.
